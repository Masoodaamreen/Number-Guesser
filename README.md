# Number-Guesser

This is a simple interactive number guessing game written in Python.

The program randomly selects a secret number between 0 and 100 (inclusive). Players are prompted to guess this number. The game provides hints after each guess, indicating if the guess is too high, too low, or "too close" to the target number. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.
